        <h2>Other Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my time both on campus and off campus, I've actively participated in various events, volunteered
            in community programs, and held several student job positions, all of which have enriched my university
            experience.

        <h3>Assistant proctor in Service for Student with Disabilities Office at Virginia Tech, 04/2023 - present</h3>
        <p>
            I have had the privilege of working as an assistant proctor for Services for Students with Disabilities for
            over a year. In addition to proctoring exams, I managed various administrative tasks such as checking
            students in and out of our system, sorting test papers, assisting students with their individual needs, and
            maintaining communication with professors. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the disability
            community, ensuring that students receive the support they need to succeed.

        <h3>CS Ambassador for VT CS Department, 08/2023 - 05/2024</h3>
        <p>
            As a volunteer CS Ambassador for the Virginia Tech Computer Science Department, I had the opportunity to
            speak at various presentations and seminars, introducing the department to prospective students and their
            families. I highlighted key aspects such as core courses, career opportunities, and study abroad programs to
            assist high school students in making informed decisions. Additionally, I volunteered at the CS career fair
            twice, offering student services and helping employers with check-in and booth setup.

        <h3>Attendee of CAPWIC Conference, 04/05/2024 - 04/07/2024</h3>
        <p>
            I was honored to represent Virginia Tech's CS female students at this conference by standing out from the
            crowd of conference scholarship applicants. During the conference, I met many outstanding CS girls, listened
            to a lot of research presentations and participated in some interesting workshops. most importantly, the
            keynote speakers' speeches helped me better understand how to explore CS career and strengthened my
            confidence to move forward on the path of CS despite the difficulties.

        <h3>Member of Dream Corps International, 05/10/2023 - 08/29/2021</h3>
        <p>
            When I first started at VT as a freshman, I joined this charity called Dream Corps. During my time here, I
            have been involved in various community service projects, such as the Roanoke Rescue Mission, some tree
            planting events, and a Valentine's Day bazaar. I love being involved in charity work because it gives me an
            indescribable feeling of satisfaction when I lend a helping hand to someone in need. I see that I am needed
            by the community, and I hope that the people I help will do the same the next time someone asks for help.
