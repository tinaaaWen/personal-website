        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Yiting Wen and my preferred name is Tina. I am a senior Computer Science student at Virginia Tech with a
            deep passion for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and UI/UX Design. My overall GPA is 3.78/4.0 and attained
            President’s List (one semester, GPA 4.0) and Dean’s List (five semesters, GPA above 3.4). I have developed
            skills in Java, Python, C languages and data algorithms, web development, and software engineering through
            various projects and experiences such as my internship, my research, and academic coursework.

        <h2>Funny Things You May Want to Know</h2>
        <p>
            Lucky? Unlucky?
            I'm lucky. I did not do well in the high school entrance examination, but because my grades were still very
            outstanding at my junior school, I got into the best high school in our province (Henan, one of China's most
            populous provinces). My last semester of high school coincided with the COVID19 epidemic, and I received
            many offers but was stranded for a year because the embassy couldn't get me a visa. My parents let me enroll
            in the national college entrance examination before, so I was lucky enough to enter a Chinese university to
            study Landscape Architecture for one year. At the end of July 2020, I received an offer from Virginia Tech,
            which came late, but fortunately I had not yet come to the U.S. I dropped offer from Penn State and then
            accepted the offer from Virginia Tech that I had longed for.
