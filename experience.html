        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Below are some highlights of my professional experiences in computer science, including a summer internship,
            research involvement, and class projects.
        </p>

        <h3>Front-end Developer at Applied Research LLC, 06/2024 - 08/2024</h3>
        <p>
            As a front-end developer, I worked on creating a web application for Jefferson Lab to monitor and analyze
            data. I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and developed the user interface with React and Material-UI. I built
            modular, reusable components like forms and modals, significantly improving user experience (UX). I also
            contributed to the overall codebase structure by implementing robust state management and event-handling
            strategies, enhancing the scalability and maintainability of the application.
        </p>

        <h3>Research Member, CS Genome at Virginia Tech, 01/2023 - 05/2023</h3>
        <p>
            As part of the CS Genome research group, I worked on promoting data maintainability and usability in the
            client API group. I also collected data on underrepresented individuals in computing for the Hidden Figures
            group. Using Python, I facilitated data transfer of GPU and created a timeline visualization using
            Timeline.js, showcasing over 150 contributions by women in High-Performance Computing.

        <h3>Team Leader, Duck Pond App Project, 01/2024 - 05/2024</h3>
        <p>
            I led the design and development of an educational app for Duck Pond visitors, aimed at enhancing user
            engagement with the natural environment and providing convenient features. I organized brainstorming
            sessions to create the prototype using Sketch and Figma, and conducted user testing to improve the app's
            usability. Feedback was analyzed through a UX Target Table, which helped iteratively refine the app.
